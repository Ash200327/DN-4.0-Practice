1. Define SPA and its Benefits
SPA (Single-Page Application) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without reloading the page.
Benefits:
Faster navigation (no full-page reloads)
Improved user experience (smooth and responsive)
Efficient data loading (only fetches data needed via APIs)
Reusable components (cleaner code structure)
Client-side rendering reduces server load

2. Define React and Identify Its Working
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for Single-Page Applications. It lets developers build UI using components.
How React Works:
Uses components (reusable, independent blocks)
Manages changes efficiently using the virtual DOM
Uses JSX, a syntax extension that combines HTML with JavaScript
Renders UI dynamically and updates only the required parts

3. Differences Between SPA and MPA
Feature	SPA (Single Page Application)	MPA (Multi Page Application)
Page Loading	Loads a single HTML page	Loads a new HTML page per request
Speed	Faster due to dynamic updates	Slower due to full-page reloads
User Experience	Smooth and seamless	May flicker on navigation
Backend Involvement	Mostly frontend handled	Heavy server-side rendering
Example Frameworks	React, Angular, Vue	PHP, ASP.NET, JSP

4. Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application
Pros:
Smooth user experience
Fast loading after initial load
Easy to turn into mobile apps (using tools like React Native)
Efficient use of bandwidth
Cons:
Poor SEO by default (harder to index)
Browser back/forward behavior needs custom handling
Initial load time may be high
JavaScript dependency (may fail if JS is disabled)

5. Explain About React
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library developed by Facebook.
It is used for building user interfaces, especially for SPAs.
React promotes component-based architecture, where UIs are broken into small, reusable components.
Uses virtual DOM for high-performance rendering.

6. Define Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM (V-DOM) is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses.
How it Works:
React creates a virtual DOM tree representation.
When data changes, it compares (diffs) the new V-DOM with the previous one.
Only the changed parts are updated in the real DOM (efficient and fast).

7. Features of React
Component-Based: Build encapsulated components.
JSX: Write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
Virtual DOM: Efficient UI updates.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Predictable behavior.
Declarative: Describe UI and React takes care of rendering.
Hooks: Functional way to manage state and side effects.
React Native: Build native mobile apps using React.
