1. Explain React Components
React components are the building blocks of any React application.
They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each with its own structure and behavior.
Think of components as custom HTML tags.
They accept inputs (called props) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

2. Differences Between Components and JavaScript Functions
Feature	React Components	JavaScript Functions
Purpose	Build UI and handle interactions	Perform specific logic/calculations
Output	Return JSX (React elements)	Return values like numbers, strings, etc.
Lifecycle	Have lifecycle methods (in class components)	No lifecycle
React Hooks	Can use hooks (in functional components)	Hooks not applicable
Integration	Part of the React DOM	Not tied to UI or React

3. Types of Components in React
React has two main types of components:
Class Components
Function Components

4. Explain Class Component
A class component is a more traditional way to define a component using the class keyword.
Syntax:
jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello from Class Component</h1>;
  }
}
Key Points:
Must extend React.Component
Must define a render() method
Can use state and lifecycle methods

5. Explain Function Component
A function component is a simpler way to write components using JavaScript functions.
Syntax:
jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello from Function Component</h1>;
}

Or using arrow functions:

jsx

const Welcome = () => <h1>Hello from Function Component</h1>;
Key Points:
Stateless (before hooks), but now can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
Easier and more readable
Preferred in modern React

6. Define Component Constructor
The constructor is a special method used in class components to:
Initialize state
Bind event handlers
Syntax:
jsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props); // always call super(props)
  this.state = {
    name: 'John'
  };
}

7. Define render() Function
The render() method is required in class components. It tells React what to display on the screen.
Syntax:
jsx
render() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
Key Points:
Must return JSX
Gets called every time the component updates or re-renders
