1. Need and Benefits of Component Life Cycle
Need:
Component lifecycle methods help developers:
Control what happens before, during, and after a component renders.
Perform tasks like data fetching, DOM manipulation, and cleanup at the right time.
Benefits:
Efficient resource management (e.g., cleaning up timers or listeners)
Smooth data loading and state updates
Better error handling
Improved performance control

2. Various Lifecycle Hook Methods (Class Components)
Phase	Method	Purpose
Mounting	constructor()	Initialize state
componentDidMount()	Run code after component is added to DOM
Updating	shouldComponentUpdate()	Decide if re-render is needed
componentDidUpdate()	Run code after component updates
Unmounting	componentWillUnmount()	Cleanup tasks (e.g., timers, listeners)
Error Handling	componentDidCatch()	Catch and handle errors in children

3. Sequence of Steps in Rendering a Component (Class Component)
Mounting Phase:
constructor()
render()
componentDidMount()

Updating Phase (when props/state change):
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
componentDidUpdate()
Unmounting Phase:
componentWillUnmount()
