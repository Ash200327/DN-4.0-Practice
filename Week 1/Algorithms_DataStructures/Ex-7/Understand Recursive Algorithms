Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem.

Example Use Case:
Predicting future financial value recursively can break the problem into smaller intervals.

For instance:
If you have an initial amount P and a growth rate r, the value after n years is:
FV(n) = FV(n - 1) * (1 + r)
