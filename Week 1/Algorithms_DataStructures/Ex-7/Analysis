Time Complexity
Basic recursion:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n) (due to call stack)

Memoized recursion:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n) (memo array + call stack)

Optimization Discussion
Recursion is elegant but can be inefficient if recomputation occurs.
Memoization avoids redundant calculations and is preferred for large n.
Iterative solutions are even more efficient in Java for production use.
