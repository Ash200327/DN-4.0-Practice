• Explain React Events
React events are objects that represent user interactions like clicks, key presses, form submissions, etc. They work similarly to DOM events but are wrapped in React’s synthetic system for cross-browser compatibility.

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>

• Explain Event Handlers
An event handler is a function that executes in response to a specific event. In React, event handlers are passed as props using camelCase syntax.

function handleClick() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
}

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>

• Define Synthetic Event
Synthetic events in React are wrapper objects around native browser events. They normalize events across different browsers to ensure consistency.

function handleInput(event) {
  console.log(event.target.value); // SyntheticEvent object
}

• Identify React Event Naming Convention
Event names use camelCase, not lowercase (e.g., onClick, onChange)
Event handlers are passed as function references, not strings
Correct:

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>

Incorrect (like in HTML):

<button onclick="handleClick()">Click</button>
