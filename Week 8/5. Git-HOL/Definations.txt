How to Clean Up and Push Back to Remote Git:
1. Clean Up Locally
After resolving merge conflicts and deleting unused branches:
Delete local merged branches:

git branch -d branch-name

Remove untracked files:

git clean -f

Remove ignored files too :

git clean -fdX

2. Push Local Changes to Remote
Make sure you're on the correct branch (e.g., master or main):

Push commits to remote:

git push origin master
