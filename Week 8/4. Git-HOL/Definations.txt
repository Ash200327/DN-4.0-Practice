How to Resolve Merge Conflicts in Git :
A merge conflict happens when two branches have conflicting changes in the same part of a file and Git cannot decide which one to keep.
When it happens:
Youâ€™ll see this message during git merge:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in filename.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts:
1. Open the conflicting file
It will look like this:

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is from current branch (e.g., master)
=======
This is from the merging branch (e.g., feature)
>>>>>>> feature

2. Edit the file manually
Decide what to keep, remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), and save the file.

3. Mark the conflict as resolved
git add filename.txt

4. Commit the merge
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in filename.txt"
