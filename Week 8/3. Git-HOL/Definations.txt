 1. Branching and Merging in Git
Branching means creating a separate version of your code to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code.
Merging means combining changes from one branch (like a feature branch) into another branch (usually the main branch).
Example:

main branch = stable code
feature1 branch = your new work

2. Creating a Branch in GitLab
Go to your project on GitLab.
Click on Repository > Branches.
Click New branch.
Give a branch name (e.g., feature-login) and choose a source branch (usually main).
Click Create branch.

3. Creating a Merge Request in GitLab
After pushing changes to your branch, go to Merge Requests tab.
Click New merge request.
Select:
Source branch (your feature branch)
Target branch (usually main)
Add title, description (optional).
Click Create merge request.
